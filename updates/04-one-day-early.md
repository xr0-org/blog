# #4: One day early

We've completed all the items from the previous goals except for (1.) under our
stretch goals.

Rather than continue focusing on this goal alone for the next couple of days,
we've decided to begin another iteration centered on verifying our new program,
so we can hopefully have it done by the end of the year.

## Next up

This iteration will run to 23 Dec. Our overarching goal is to move towards
verifying the above program, but in order to keep the iteration achievable we
are breaking this task into two stages, the first of which we will focus on in
this iteration.

Our goals:

1. We will verify all but one of the functions that directly invoke `malloc` (or
   `calloc`, `realloc`) and `free`
   [[#15](https://todo.sr.ht/~lbnz/xr0/15)]

2. Simplify map and array data structures
   [[#13](https://todo.sr.ht/~lbnz/xr0/13)].

Stretch goals:

1. Write a first-version of the "topological sort" mechanism
   [[#16](https://todo.sr.ht/~lbnz/xr0/16)].
