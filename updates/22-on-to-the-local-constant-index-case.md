# #22: On to the local-constant index case

tl;dr only today

## tl;dr

Weâ€™ve finished the [local-constant size case](https://github.com/xr0-org/xr0/issues/58)
of buffer out-of-bounds prevention, having added caller verification of bounds.
Our attention now turns to the final special case we identified, that involving
[local-constant indexes](https://github.com/xr0-org/xr0/issues/59). We will
spend the next two weeks working on this and hope to have some interesting
progress by then.

See you on Oct 5.
