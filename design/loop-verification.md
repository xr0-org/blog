# Loop verification

## Definition

By _undefined behaviour_ or _UB_ is usually meant anything classified as such in
the C Standard. In this article we will use the term in a more restricted sense,
referring to violations of any of the safety semantics that Xr0 is currently
concerned with, such as reading uninitialised memory, dereferencing of pointers
not pointing at valid blocks and invalid frees like double frees.
We also include in this term memory leaks, which are not technically UB
according to the Standard.
However, we exclude anything that Xr0 is not yet verifying, like the absence of
all kind of buffer overflows.

## Overview

The two main questions in connection with a loop (or any other construct) are

1. Does it contain any UB?

2. What is its net effect on the state?

So we want to verify that the loop itself is safe, and then track its impact of
the state. As an example of the former, if the loop body calls free on some
variable, we must be able to show that this variable always has a deallocand
value at this moment. For the latter, if the loop allocates memory in some
variable, we need to take account of this side effect.

This verification can be distinguished into internal and external aspects.

## Internal verification

Basically we want to show that, given the initial conditions, it is impossible
for UB to occur, and then that the annotated side effects will
occur.

Like in the verification of a function, an integral part of our ability to do
verification comes down to the spec provided by the user. The spec gives us both
our initial conditions (in the `setup` for a function) and the net effect we
measure against. In the loop internal verification case this comes down to the
invariant. The invariant gives us initial conditions, because we verify that it
is initially true given the context in which the loop appears. The invariant
also gives us the net effect of the loop body (not of the loop) because the
body's task is to maintain the truth of the invariant.

### While(1) form

The essential character of a loop is repetition. So every loop can be expressed
in the form

```C
while (1) { /* do things */ }
```

This form is preferable to that with an explicit termination condition, such as

```C
while (*p) { /* do things */ }
```

because in the latter we will be led to verifying the evaluation of the
termination condition separately from the loop body. So we express this instead
as

```C
while (1) {
        if (!*p) break;
        /* do things */
}
```

We call this _while(1) form_.
It emphasises that the invariant is the truly characteristic interface to the
loop: everything important must be related to it.

#### Example

```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 9) {
        i++;
}
```

is rephrased as

```C
int i = 0;
while (1) {
        if (!(i < 9)) break;
        i++;
}
```

### Setup invariants

The above example gives us a good starting point. In order to safely execute the
body

```C
if (!(i < 9)) break;
i++;
```

we must first know that `i` has a value. So the invariant must state this
assumption:

```C
int i = 0;
while (1) ~ [ setup: i = [?]; ] {
        if (!(i < 9)) break;
        i++;
}
```

So the user would write something like:

```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 9) ~ [ setup: i = [?]; ] {
        i++;
}
```

Now this may seem silly in light of the fact that `i` is defined right before
the loop, but it is critical because in general

1. Previous executions of the loop body may invalidate what is true initially

2. It ensures us that the interface between the loop and the outside world is
   the invariant.

#### Example

A more striking example (in which we ask the reader to ignore the possibility of
failed allocations) is

```C
int i;
void *p = malloc(10);
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        p[i] = malloc(1);
}
```

Translating into while(1) form we get

```C
int i;
void *p = malloc(10);
i = 0;
while (1) {
        if (!(i < 10)) break;
        p[i] = malloc(1);
        i++;
}
```

Here the invariant must insist that `p[i]` is well-defined before each
iteration (if `i < 10`):

```C
while (1) ~ [
        setup: {
                i = [0?];
                p = .clump(10);
        }
]{
        if (!(i < 10)) break;
        p[i] = malloc(1);
        i++;
}
```

The restriction `0 â‰¤ i` is necessary because the break condition only ensures us
that `i < 10` whenever

```C
p[i] = malloc(1);
```

is executed.

### Effect invariants

The keen reader will have observed that we didn't annotate the side effect

```C
p[i] = malloc(1);
```

above.
This would be done in the following way:

```C
while (1) ~ [
        setup: {
                i = [0?];
                p = .clump(10);
        }
        if (i < 10) p[i] = malloc(1);
]{
        if (!(i < 10)) break;
        p[i] = malloc(1);
        i++;
}
```

The sense of this annotation is that a given iteration of the loop will, if
`i < 10`, upon assumption of the `setup`, assign `malloc(1)` to the `i`-th
element of `p`.
It is therefore still a wholly internal consideration.

### Net effect

In order to refer to the effect of the loop as a whole, we have to extend our
syntax further.
In the first place, the invariant needs to capture the progress that previous
iterations accomplish:

```C
while (1) ~ [
        setup: {
                int j; /* dummy variable in loop below */

                i = [0?11];
                p = .clump(10);
                for (j = 0; j < i; j++) p[j] = malloc(1);
        }
        if (i < 10) {
                p[i] = malloc(1);
                i++;
        }
]{
        if (!(i < 10)) break ~ [
                /* `i' is a dummy variable below */
                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) p[i] = malloc(1);
        ];
        p[i] = malloc(1);
        i++;
}
```

#### Example: partial action

But there is a problem. What happens when the context prior to the loop
accomplishes part of the alleged net effect?

```C
int i;
void *p = malloc(10);
p[0] = malloc(1);
p[1] = malloc(1);
p[2] = malloc(1);
i = 3;
while (1) ~ [
        setup: {
                int j;

                i = [0?11];
                p = .clump(10);
                for (j = 0; j < i; j++) p[j] = malloc(1);
        }
        if (i < 10) {
                p[i] = malloc(1);
                i++;
        }
]{
        if (!(i < 10)) break ~ [
                for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) p[i] = malloc(1);
        ];
        p[i] = malloc(1);
        i++;
}
```

The net effect annotated above is clearly false, since only

```C
for (i = 3; i < 10; i++) p[i] = malloc(1);
```

will be accomplished. But, on the other hand, it is the direct result of
plugging `i = 10` into the invariant

```C
for (j = 0; j < i; j++) p[j] = malloc(1);
```

So how would we detect that it is false?
This confusion arises because the invariant is talking about what is true,
whereas the net effect about what the loop has accomplished.

## External verification

- objects potentially affected by loop have rconst value afterward
